# Algorithms

### _A algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem._



<p>Algorithms are used in every part of computer science. They form the field's backbone. In computer science, an algorithm gives the computer a specific set of instructions, which allows the computer to do everything, be it running a calculator or running a rocket. These decisions are all made by algorithms.</p>
